# tree-sitter-haskell-literate

Tree-sitter grammar for Literate Haskell.

## Supported notations

This grammar supports three separate Literate Haskell notations, shown below highlighted in the [Helix editor](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix).

First is the so-called Bird-style:

Second is LaTeX-style:

Third is Markdown-style:

For Markdown-style, you will need to use something like [`markdown-unlit`](https://github.com/sol/markdown-unlit) to get compilation support.
